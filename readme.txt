 - This program allows users to add one of each type of tournament  (league, youth league, knockout)
 - Team data is stored and to be used to store placement data needed in the other tournament classes

 How to use: 
    1. Upon running user will be prompted to add a tournament, select one of the options.
        - NOTE: youth league cannot be added without existing league.

    2. After entering desired tournaments and choosing to continue, the user will be prompted to choose a league to modify.
        - This allows user to choose which tournament to interact with.

    3. After choosing a league to modify, the user will be shown options of interaction.
        - Most options are straight forward and will walk the user through the process.
        - However, add matchday needs to be discussed as there is a difference between the tournament types.

    4. For all non-knockout tournaments (options 1 and 3), the user will be prompted to enter all possible matches between existing teams at once.
       For knockout, the user will only enter one match at a time.
        - User must ensure integrity of data entered into non-KO tournaments.
